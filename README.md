Here i have build a Interactive Navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item.
The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages.Use HTML to structure the menu,CSS to style it,and JavaScript to add interactivity,such as changing the background color.
